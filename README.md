LAMMPS-GUI - The graphical interface for learning and running LAMMPS

## LAMMPS-GUI vs. LAMMPS

LAMMPS-GUI officially "lives" in the "tools/lammps-gui" folder of the LAMMPS source distribution
and this the LAMMPS git repository.  This repository is a mirror that only contains LAMMPS-GUI
itself and thus it is rather low overhead.  LAMMPS-GUI has the option to load a seperately
compiled LAMMPS shared library dynamically at runtime and this version defaults to this setting
(unlike the version bundled with LAMMPS which defaults on linking LAMMPS directly).

## Compiling LAMMPS-GUI

LAMMPS-GUI uses CMake.
