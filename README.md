## LAMMPS-GUI vs. LAMMPS

LAMMPS-GUI used to "live" in the "tools/lammps-gui" folder of the LAMMPS source distribution
and the LAMMPS git repository.  This made it easy to build LAMMPS-GUI together with LAMMPS.
However, LAMMPS-GUI has matured to the point, that it is easier to maintain it as a separate
package and make its release schedule independent from LAMMPS releases.  It is still possible
to build LAMMPS-GUI as before, but that will just automatically first download the LAMMPS-GUI
sources from this repository.
